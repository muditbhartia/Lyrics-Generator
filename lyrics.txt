----------------- Song name: Bigger Stronger -----------------

I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I think I want to change my attitude 
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air, my atmosphere
I wanna be strong

I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I think I need to change my attitude 
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air, my atmosphere
I wanna be strong

Bigger, and better
Bigger, and better
Bigger, and better
Bigger, and better
Bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go

----------------- Song name: No More Keeping My Feet On The Ground -----------------

Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,
I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me,
But I wake up,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling.

Sometimes I feel overcharged, it's surprising,
Surprisingly good to be moving around,
So I wake up,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling.

So what? I feel fine,
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,
I'm alright, I feel good,
So I'll go, I'll try to start moving.

Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,
And I've got to get going 
So much that I wanted to do,
But I wake up,
Smiling.

And this could be my last chance,
I'm saving my only chance,
And this could be my last chance,
No more keeping my feet on the ground.

Sometimes I feel overcharged, it's surprising,
Surprisingly good to be moving around,
And I move,
I wake up,
Smiling.

So what? I feel fine,
I feel OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,
I'm alright, I feel good,
So I'll go, well it's time to start moving on.

And this could be my last chance,
I'm saving my only chance,
And this could be my last chance,
So no more keeping my feet on the ground.

I'm not gonna keep them, 
I'm not gonna keep them down

The cardboard head I see
Has found its way to me
It's old and it's old and it's old
Making me cry
I sleep but I will not move
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated, oh no

What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear
And the things from which you can't escape"

Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others, oh no

What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear
And the things which you cannot explain"

And it's making me cry love
And it's making me cry
And I'm slipping away love
And I'm slipping away
It's only superstition, only your imagination
It's only superstition, only superstition

Have yourself a merry little christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be far away

Happy golden days of yore

Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow

At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Could not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me

And the clouds burst to show daylight

Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine

On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn child
And at full tilt, and in full flight
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight

Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Ooh and I realized
Who cannot live without
Ooh come apart without
Daylight

Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight

----------------- Song name: A Rush Of Blood To The Head -----------------

He said, I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
He said, I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls

Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
And do back the things it did to you in return

He said, I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh and I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They said start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on

Said, I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside me baby, watch the orange glow
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why

So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh to the head

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on

So meet me by the bridge
Oh meet me by the lane
When am I gonna see
That pretty face again?

Oh meet me on the road
Meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head

----------------- Song name: Amsterdam -----------------

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And if I, oh if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear, I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

And time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
Oh, it's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end
Of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again

Stood on a bridge
Tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach

You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets

Stood on the edge
Tied to a noose
And you came along
And you cut me loose

You came along
And you cut me loose
You came along
And you cut me loose

----------------- Song name: Crests Of Waves -----------------

It could be worse
I could be alone
I could be locked in here on my own
Like a stone that suddenly drops
It never stops, no

I could be lost
Or I could be saved
Calling out from beneath the waves
Beaten down by this ocean rain
Never again
Never again

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Screaming out from the crests of waves

It could be worse
Bitter or sweet
You could be snapped from the jaws of defeat
Or like a light lit upon a beach
Wear your heart on your sleeve
Oh

You want to stop before you begin
You want to sink when you know you could swim
You want to stop just before you begin
Never give in
Never give in

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Screaming out from the crests of waves

Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Except life and the love you make

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Screaming out from the crests of waves

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Screaming out from the crests of waves
Where you're longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Where you're longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves

If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I
I wish
I wish

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If you're gonna break down, you can break on me
If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If it's gonna rain down, it can rain on me
It can rain on me

----------------- Song name: Yellow -----------------

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"

So, then, I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to've done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn it into something beautiful
D'you know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
D'you know
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

----------------- Song name: Clocks -----------------

The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Curse missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

You are
You are
You are
You are

You are
You are

And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)

----------------- Song name: In My Place -----------------

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost
Oh yeah 

I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost
Oh yeah 

Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Yeah
How long must you pay for it?
Yeah
How long must you wait for it? 
Oh for it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and under prepared
But I'll wait for it 

If you go, if you go
Leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you (yeah) 

Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Yeah
How long must you pay for it?
Yeah
How long must you wait for it? 
Oh for it

Singing please, please, please
Come back and sing to me
To me, me
Come on and sing it out
Now, now
Come on and sing it out
To me, me 
Come back and sing 

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
Oh yeah.

----------------- Song name: Amsterdam -----------------

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And if I, oh if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear, I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

And time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
Oh, it's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end
Of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again

Stood on a bridge
Tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach

You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets

Stood on the edge
Tied to a noose
And you came along
And you cut me loose

You came along
And you cut me loose
You came along
And you cut me loose

----------------- Song name: Square One -----------------

You're in control
Is there anywhere you wanna go?
You're in control
Is there anything you wanna know?
The future's for discovering
The space in which we're travelling

From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass, draw me a map
I'm on the top, I can't get back

The first line of the first page
To the end in the last place you were looking
From the start in your own way
You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too?
Are they bleeding all your colours into one?
And if you come undone
As if you've been run through
Some catapult had fired you
You wonder if your chance'll ever come
Or if you're stuck in square one

----------------- Song name: What If -----------------

What if there was no light
Nothing wrong, nothing right
What if there was no time?
And no reason or rhyme?
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?

What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try?
Ooh, that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life?
That you don't want me there by your side?

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try?
Ooh, that's right

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
You know that darkness always turns into light
Ooh, that's right

----------------- Song name: White Shadows -----------------

When I was a young boy
I tried to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little white shadows
Blink and miss them
Part of a system I am

If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up
Oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy
I tried to listen
Don't you want to feel like that?
You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system, a plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up
Oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

Swimming on a sea of faces
The tide of the human race, and so
An answer now is what I need
I see it in the new sun rising
I see it break on your horizon, oh
Come on love, stay with me

----------------- Song name: Fix You -----------------

When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

----------------- Song name: Talk -----------------

Oh brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been tryin' hard to reach you 'cause I don't know what to do
Oh brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh I wanna talk to you

You could take a picture of something you see
And in the future, where would I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how you feel
Well I feel like they're talkin' in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
And in the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done
Do something that's never been done


So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
But nothing's really makin' any sense at all
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk

----------------- Song name: X&Y -----------------

Trying hard to speak and
Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
It's all part of the plan
When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way you can

I dive in at the deep end
She become my best friend
I want to love you
But I don't know if I can
I know something is broken
And I'm trying to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way I can

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You and me are floating on a tidal wave… together
You and me are drifting into outer space… and singing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You and me are floating on a tidal wave… together
You and me are drifting into outer space
You and me are floating on a tidal wave… together
You and me are drifting into outer space… and singing

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

----------------- Song name: Speed Of Sound -----------------

How long before I get in
Before it starts, before I begin
How long before you decide
Or before I know what it feels like
Where to, where do I go
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand
I'll start before I can stop
Or before I see things the right way up

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Or Japan and China all lit up
A sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I could've seen
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand

All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent, ooh

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand

----------------- Song name: A Message -----------------

My song is love
Love to the loveless shore
And it goes on
You don't have to be alone

Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see you clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not going to take it back
And I'm not going to say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I get that message home

My song is love
My song is love alone
But I'm on fire for you clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not going to take it back
And I'm not going to say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

And I'm not going to stand and wait
Not going to leave it until it's much too late
On a platform I'm going to stand and say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home

My song is love, is love alone
And I've got to get that message home

----------------- Song name: Low -----------------

You see the world in black and white, no colour or light
You think you'll never get it right but you're wrong, you might
The sky could fall, could fall on me, the parting of the sea
But you mean more, mean more to me than any colour I can see

All you ever wanted was love but you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up as us

You see the world in black and white, not painted bright
You see no meaning to your life, you should try, you should try

All you ever wanted was love but you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up
Don't you want to see it come soon floating in a big white balloon
Come give her your own silver spoon
Don't you want to see it come down, there for throwing your arms around
And say "You're not a moment too soon"

'Cause I feel low, 'cause I feel low, ooh...
Yeah I feel low, oh no, ooh...
Ooh, 'cause I feel low (ah), 'cause I feel low, ooh...
Yeah I feel low, oh no, ooh...

----------------- Song name: The Hardest Part -----------------

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
Oh, and I
I wonder what it's all about

I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh, and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah, that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part

----------------- Song name: Swallowed In The Sea -----------------

You cut me down a tree
And brought it back to me
And that's what made me see
Where I was going wrong

You put me on a shelf
And kept me for yourself
I can only blame myself
You can only blame me

And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
Or swallowed in the sea

You put me on the line
And hung me out to dry
And darling that's when I
Decide to go to see

You cut me down to size
And opened up my eyes
Made me realize
What I could not see

And I could write a book
The one they'll say that shook
The world, and then it took
It took it back from me

And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea

And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well that's where I belong
And you belong with me

The streets your walking on
A thousand houses long
Well that's where I belong
And you belong with me

Oh what good is it to live
With nothing left to give
Forget, but not forgive
Not loving all you see

All the streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well that's where I belong
And you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea

You belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
Yeah, you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea

----------------- Song name: Twisted Logic -----------------

Sunlight, opened up my eyes
To see for the first time
You'll open them up
And tonight, rivers will run dry
And not for the first time
Rivers will run

Hundreds of years in the future
There could be computers
Looking for life on earth

Don't fight for the wrong side
Say what you feel like
Say how you feel

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go

Created, then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it
Someone will mess it up

And you are not wrong to
Ask who does this belong to
It belongs to all of us

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards again
You'll go forwards again
You'll go forwards

----------------- Song name: Til Kingdom Come -----------------

One... two...
Steal my heart... and hold my tongue
I feel my time... my time has come
Let me in... unlock the door
I never felt this way before

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come

Hold my head... inside your hands
I need someone... who understands
I need someone... someone who hears
For you I've waited all these years

For you I'd wait... 'til Kingdom Come
Until my day... my day is done
And say you'll come... and set me free
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me

In your tears... and in your blood
In your fire... and in your flood
I hear you laugh... I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know what I've become

For you I'd wait... 'til kingdom come
Until my days... my days are done
Say you'll come... and set me free
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me

Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me

----------------- Song name: How You See The World -----------------

Are you missing something?
Looking for something?
Tired of everything?
Searching and struggling?
Are you worried about it?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Oh you're gonna get it right sometime

There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
Are you running in a circle?
You can't be too careful
And you can't relate it
'Cause it's complicated
Oh you're gonna get it right sometime
You're gonna get it right sometime

That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you heard?
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna get hurt
Ooh

Is there something missing?
Is nobody listening?
Are you scared of what you don't know?
Don't wanna end up on your own
You need conversation
And information
Oh you're gonna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
But you can't believe a word?
That's how you see the world
Oh don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can hurt
Youooooooooooh
Ooh
Ooh

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world

----------------- Song name: Things I Don't Understand -----------------

How tides control the sea
And what becomes of me
How little things can slip out of your hands
How often people change
Though two remain the same
Why things don't always turn out as you plan
These are things that I don't understand
Yeah these are things that I don't understand

(I can't) And I can't decide
(Wrong) Oh my wrong from right
(Day) Or my day from night
(Or dark) Or the dark from light
(I love) But I love this life

How infinite is space
And who decides your fate
Why everything will dissolve into sand
How to avoid defeat
Where truth and fiction meet
Why nothing ever turns out as you plan
These are things that I don't understand
Yeah these are things that I don't understand

(I can't) And I can't decide
(Wrong) Oh my wrong from right
(Day) Or my day from night
(Or dark) Or the dark from light
(I love) But I love this life

----------------- Song name: Proof -----------------

So I waited for you
What wouldn't I do
And I'm covered it's true
I'm covered in you

And if I ever want proof
I find it in you
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

Light and dark
Bright spark
Light and dark
And then light

So I waited all day
What wouldn't I say
And are there things in the way
Things happen that way

Oh and if I ever want proof
Then I find it in you
Oh, yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

Light and dark
Bright spark
Light and dark
And then light

Light, light, light, light

----------------- Song name: The World Turned Upside Down -----------------

X and Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
That and this
We're part of a bigger plan
Don't know what it is
Don't know what it is

You and me
The land, sun, trees, the sky, the stars, the sea
365 degrees
I am a puzzle, you're the missing piece
Hang on a minute, just a minute, please
I'll come
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Pilots up and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

X is Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
365 degrees
All of the surface and the underneath
Searching your mellow and outsings your key, ah
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Pilots up and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

And you don't know that you've been born
Can't see the calm until the storm
Can't tell your right side from your wrong
Can't see the wave you're riding on

----------------- Song name: Pour Me -----------------

Poor me, floating out to sea 
An opportunity that went bad 
Poor you, now what you gonna do? 
Now what you gonna do? 
You just cry 

Poor me, so blind I couldn't see
The forest for the trees
I don't know why
Poor you, you split yourself in two
Now what you gonna do?
You just cry

I hear you, come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 
I hear you, come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 

Poor me, floating out to sea 
An opportunity that went bad 
Poor you, now what you gonna do? 
Oh, what you gonna do? 
You just cry 

I hear you, come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 
I hear you, come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 

I don't understand 
I don't understand

----------------- Song name: Sleeping Sun -----------------

Climb up your mountain
Nineteen and countin'
You have got seven, I have got one

Blinded and hurtin'
This I'm deserving
I've got my secrets
You've only got the sleeping sun

When you've got a secret
Then you've got to keep it
When you've got a question
Answers will come

Running and hiding
Take and dividing
You've got your secrets
I've only got a sleeping sun

Sleeping sun
Singing
Ooh um
Oh oh...
Ah ah
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

And you, as I, saw
A piece in a jigsaw
Run up and around it and
Jump up real tall

Run round the houses
North and the souths'
You've got your answers we've
Only got a sleeping sun

Sleeping sun
Singing
Ooh um
Oh oh...
Ah ah
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

----------------- Song name: Gravity -----------------

Baby
It's been a long time coming
Such a long, long time
And I can't stop running
Such a long, long time
Can you hear my heart beating?
Can you hear that sound?
'Cause I can't help thinking
And I won't stop now

And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone

Baby
When your wheels stop turning
And you feel let down
And it seems like troubles
Have come all around
I can hear your heart beating
I can hear that sound
But I can't help thinking
And I won't look now

And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone
On everyone

On everyone
On everyone
On everyone

Computer voice: R-E-M-I-X

Oh, brother I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you
'Cause I don't know what to do
Oh, brother I can't believe it's true (believe it's true)
I'm so scared about the future
And I wanna talk to you

Computer voice: Now talk baby!
Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done

Computer voice: Now talk baby!
Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

Are you lost or incomplete
Do you feel like a puzzle
You can't find your missing piece
Tell me how you feel

How you feel...
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk...

So you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You'll tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored
When you worry about the future or the third world war
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk...

Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

----------------- Song name: Talk (Francois K Dub) -----------------

Then I take a picture of something you see
You see...
You see...
You see...
You see...
In the future...
In the future...
In the future...
In the future...
In the future where will I be?

Oh, please talk to me

Can you fill the colors missing you need?
Will I ever get the answer I need?
Oh, please talk to me

Please talk
To me

----------------- Song name: Talk (Junkie XL Mix) -----------------

Oh brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been tryin' hard to reach you 'cause I don't know what to do
Oh brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh I wanna talk to you

You could take a picture of something you see
And in the future, where would I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how you feel
Well I feel like they're talkin' in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
And in the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done
Do something that's never been done


So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
But nothing's really makin' any sense at all
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk

----------------- Song name: Cemeteries Of London -----------------

At night they would go walking
'Til the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets they go searching
To see God in their own way
Save the night time for your weeping
Your weeping

Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
And the night over London lay

So we rode down to the river
Where Victorian ghosts pray
For their curses to be broken
We go underneath the arches
Where the witches are and they say
There are ghost towns in the ocean
The ocean

Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
And the night over London lay

God is in the houses
And God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London
I see God come in my garden
But I don't know what He said
For my heart, it wasn't open
Not open

Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
And the night over London lay

Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
There's no light over London today

----------------- Song name: Lost! -----------------

Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better or no worse

I just got lost!
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost!
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the firing's stopped
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

----------------- Song name: 42 -----------------

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh

Time is so short
And I'm sure
There must be something more

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head, oh
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh

Time is so short
And I'm sure
There must be something more

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you, oh, oh

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head

----------------- Song name: Lovers In Japan/Reign Of Love -----------------

Lovers In Japan
Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners, until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we're gonna get out

Tonight, maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Ohohohoh ohohohoh oh
Dreaming of when the morning comes

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, the sun will come out

Reign Of Love
Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer this heavy load
Locust wind
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner in a reign of love

Locust wind
Let us stop
How I wish I'd spoken up
To a reign of love

Reign of love by the church we're waiting
Reign of love on my knees go praying
How I wish I'd spoken up
Away get carried on a reign of love

----------------- Song name: Yes -----------------

When it started, we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line, my back's on the ropes
When it started, we were alright
But night makes a fool of us in the daylight

There we were dying of frustration
Singing, "Lord lead me not into temptation"
But it's not easy when she turns you on
Sin, stay gone

If you'd only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness

So, up they picked me by the big toe 
I was held from the rooftop, then they let go
Dizzily screaming, "Let the windows down"
As I crawl to the ground

If you'd only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness

----------------- Song name: Viva La Vida -----------------

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

----------------- Song name: Violet Hill -----------------

Was a long and dark December; from the rooftops I remember
There was snow; white snow
Clearly I remember, from the windows they were watching
While we froze, down below
When the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots
On show, you'd better lie low
If you love me, won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December, when the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles, hollowed out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft
Bury me in armour; when I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze
And if you love me, won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier, who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below
So if you love me, why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill; there we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?

----------------- Song name: Strawberry Swing -----------------

They were sitting
They were sitting in the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious

They were sitting
They were talking in the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't want to waste a thing

Cold cold water, bring me 'round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold cold water, whatcha say?
It's such, it's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't want to change a thing

People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away?
And it's such, it's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

Ahh...

Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time

Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time

Now the sky could be blue
Could be grey
Without you, I'm just miles away

Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time

----------------- Song name: Death And All His Friends -----------------

All winter, we got carried
Away over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer, we just hurried
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry

So come over, just be patient and don't worry
And don't worry

No, I don't wanna battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't wanna follow Death and all of his friends

No, I don't want to battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't wanna follow Death and all of his friends

----------------- Song name: Lost? -----------------

Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I've stopped
Doesn't mean I'm across

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse

I just got lost!
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost!
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the firing's stopped
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

----------------- Song name: Life In Technicolor II -----------------

There's a wild wind blowing
Down the corner of my street
Every night there the headlights are glowing

There's a cold war coming
On the radio I heard
Baby it's a violent world

Oh love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow
I can hear it coming
I can hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a-creeping
Oh and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes o-o-o-on
Time'll leak and lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night

Oh oh love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow
I can hear it coming
Like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Gravity release me
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground

----------------- Song name: Glass Of Water -----------------

Scared of losin' all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
With ripples and the rhymes
He asked, "Will I see heaven in mine?"

That is just the way it was
And nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
"Will I see heaven in mine?"
Oh

Son
Don't ask
Neither how full nor empty
Is your glass
Cling
To the mast
Spend your whole life
Living in the past
Going nowhere fast

So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime
"Stars in heaven align"
Oh

Son
Don't ask
Neither how full nor empty
Is your glass
Cling
To the mast
Spend your whole life
Living in the past
Going nowhere fast

What are we drinking when we're done?
Glasses of water

----------------- Song name: Rainy Day -----------------

Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and green
At night it was the bright of a lonely day
Time is just floating away

Then there was rain
The sound foundations are crumbling
Through the ground comes a bit of a-tumbling
And time was just floating away
What could we say?
And we can listen

Oh rainy day, come around
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now, I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Then there was rain
I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart would have broke again
Times so vicious
Saying deeper that the knife goes in, the more you win
You end up with less than when you begin
Deeper that the knife goes in

Oh rainy day, come around
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now, I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

----------------- Song name: Prospekt's March/Poppyfields -----------------

Smoke is rising from the houses
People burying their dead
I asked somebody what the time is
But time doesn't matter to them yet

People talking without speaking
Trying to take what they can get
I ask you if you remember
Prospekt, how could I forget

Drums
Here it comes
Don't you wish that life could be as simple
As fish swimming round in a barrel when you've got the gun?

Oh, when I run
Here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get the other kind of control
But I wasn't one

But here I lie
On my own in a separate sky
And here I lie
On my own in a separate sky
I don't wanna die
On my own here tonight
But here I lie
On my own in a separate sky

----------------- Song name: Lost+ -----------------

No better and no worse

You might be a big fish

(Jay-Z)
Uh-huh
I got you
Uh

With the same sword they knight you
They gon' good night you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael

See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus, see success is like suicide

Suicide, this is suicide
If you succeed, prepare to be crucified
Media meddles
Niggaz sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you have to be Bobby now

The question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having it all
Because...

(Chris Martin)
I'm just waiting till the shine wears off
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off

----------------- Song name: Lovers In Japan (Osaka Sun Mix) -----------------

Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners, until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even right is wrong

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we are gonna get out

Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Oh oh...
Dreaming of when the morning comes

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out

----------------- Song name: Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground -----------------

Let me go
Boys, let me go
Push my boat from the highest cliff
To the sea below

Rocks awaiting
Boys, rocks await
Swoop down from the sky and catch me
Like a bird of prey

Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime
To be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Saying
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime
To be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Tides that I tried to swim against

Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Curse missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

You are
You are
You are
You are

You are

And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
Oh, and I
I wonder what it's all about

I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh, and that's the hardest part

I'll be down where the waters flow

----------------- Song name: Fix You -----------------

When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

So come over, just be patient and don't worry
And don't worry

No, I don't wanna battle from beginning to end

No, I don't want to battle from beginning to end

I don't wanna follow Death and all of his friends

----------------- Song name: Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall -----------------

I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw, oh, this light, I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright, as we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall, is a waterfall, oh, is a waterfall,
Oh, is a, is a waterfall, every tear is a waterfall

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag
It was a waaaterfall
A waaaterfall

Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall

----------------- Song name: Major Minus -----------------

They got one eye watching you, one eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to
They got one eye watching you, one eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do
And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on you

They got one eye watching you, one eye on what you do
So be careful cause nothing they say is true
No d-don't believe a word, it's just us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard
Hear the crocodiles ticking 'round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking 'round the world

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on you
You could hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting while my left hides under the chairs

Ah
Ah

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on you

----------------- Song name: Moving To Mars -----------------

Somewhere up above the stars
The wreckage of a universe floats past
Somewhere up above my heart
A tiny little seed is sown,
A government is overthrown,
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last

And I heard it on the radio
That one day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a TV show
That somewhere up above
And in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart,
Maybe moving us to mars
We won't see the earth again
In these seconds just remain unchanged

Eight to nine, nine to ten
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again you and me
We are meeting for the first time
Can't you see
Seven six five four three
We are meeting for the first time
Singing this space symphony

They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to mars,
Past the satellites and stars
They're moving us to mars

----------------- Song name: Hurts Like Heaven -----------------

Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
'Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark?'
It's so cold it's so cold
It's so cold it's so cold
Written up in marker on a factory sign
'I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine'
It's so cold it's so cold
It's so cold it's so cold
See the arrow they shot
Trying to tear us apart
Take the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go

Of you- ooh ooh
'Cause you do
Oh you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

On every street every car every surface a name
Tonight the streets are ours
And we're writing and saying
Don't let 'em take control
No we won't let 'em take control
Yes I feel a little bit nervous
Yes I feel nervous and I cannot relax
How come they're out to get us
How come they're out when they don't know the facts
So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark
On a concrete canvas I'll go making my mark
Armed with a spraycan soul
I'll be armed with a spraycan soul
And you ooh ooh
You ooh ooh
'Cause you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
Yeah it's true
When you
Use your heart as a weapon
Then it hurts like heaven
And it hurts like heaven
Oh oh oh-oh

And it hurts like heaven
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

----------------- Song name: Paradise -----------------

Ooh
Ooh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Ooh
Ooh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night
She'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night
Away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh

She dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh

La la la-la la-la
La la la-la la-la
La la la-la la-la
La la la

Still lying underneath the stormy skies
She said, oh
I know the sun is set to rise

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh

Oh-oh ooh

This could be para-para-paradise
Could be para-para-paradise
Could be para-para-paradise
Oh

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

----------------- Song name: Charlie Brown -----------------

Stole a key
And took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free

I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose, come burst in the concrete
Be a cartoon heart

Light a fire, fire the spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart, we'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls, all the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows as the room is spinning
We'll run riot, we'll be glowing in the dark

So, so, reminiscing wild
We'll be glowing in the dark

----------------- Song name: Us Against The World -----------------

Oh, morning come bursting the clouds, amen
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
And bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart she left a hole

The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

And sing slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Like a river to a raindrop I lost a friend
My drunken as a Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don't let go

And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
And lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain

Saying slow it down
Slow it down

Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

----------------- Song name: Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall -----------------

I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw, oh, this light, I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright, as we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall, is a waterfall, oh, is a waterfall,
Oh, is a, is a waterfall, every tear is a waterfall

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag
It was a waaaterfall
A waaaterfall

Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall

----------------- Song name: Major Minus -----------------

They got one eye watching you, one eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to
They got one eye watching you, one eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do
And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on you

They got one eye watching you, one eye on what you do
So be careful cause nothing they say is true
No d-don't believe a word, it's just us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard
Hear the crocodiles ticking 'round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking 'round the world

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on you
You could hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting while my left hides under the chairs

Ah
Ah

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on you

----------------- Song name: U.F.O. -----------------

Lord, I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river's going to flow
It just seems that upstream I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

And that light hits your eyes
I know I swear we find somewhere
The streets are paved with gold
Bullets fly, split the sky
But that's all right, sometimes sunlight
Comes streaming through the holes

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

----------------- Song name: Up In Flames -----------------

So it's over
This time I know it's gone
Salt water
Tasted it too long
I only know I'm wrong
Now, I know it's gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

So it's over
This time you're flying on
This time I know no song
Can stop it's slowly burn
Can stop it's slowly gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
We have slowly gone
Can't we pour some water on?

----------------- Song name: Don't Let It Break Your Heart -----------------

And
If I lost the map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
And she'd call

"When you're tired of racing, and you
Find you never left the start
Come on, baby
Don't let it break your heart"

Though 
Heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Try to catch a cannonball
And a slow 
Burning tide
Oh, through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck I heard her call

And she said
"When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still, you'll never hit the mark, oh
And even in your rains and shadows
Still, we never gonna part
Ah, come on, baby
Don't let it break your heart, oh
Don't let it break your heart, oh
Don't let it break your heart"

Don't let it break your heart

----------------- Song name: Up With The Birds -----------------

The birds, they sang at break of day
"Start again," I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away
The birds they sang all the choir
"Start again," a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of grey

The sky is blue, dreamed out loud 'til it's true
Then taken back the part, shine through
My arms turn wings, oh those clumsy things
Send me up to that wonderful world
And then I'm up with the birds

Might have to go where they don't know my name
Float all over the world just to see her again
And I won't show a fear, any pain
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain
A simple plot, but I know one thing
Good things are coming our way
A simple plot, but I know one thing
Good things are coming our way, oh yeah

----------------- Song name: Always In My Head -----------------

I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do, but
I don't forget
My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try my heart stays still
It never moves, just won't be led

And so my mouth waters to be fed
And you're always in my head

You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head

You're always in my head
Always in my
Always in my

This, I guess
Is to tell you you're chosen
Out from the rest

----------------- Song name: Magic -----------------

Call it magic
Call it true
I call it magic
When I'm with you

And I just got broken
Broken into two
Still I call it magic
When I'm next to you

And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Call it magic
Cut me into two
And with all your magic
I disappear from view

And I can't get over
Can't get over you
Still I call it magic
You're such a precious jewel

And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Want to fall
I fall so far
I want to fall
I fall so hard

And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it ma-ma-ma-magic

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
"Still believe in magic?"
Well, yes, I do
Well, yes, I do
Well, yes, I do
Well, yes, I do
Of course I do

----------------- Song name: Ink -----------------

Got a tattoo that said, 'together through life'
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up will it be all right?
Feels like there's something broken inside

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Got a tattoo and the pain's all right
Just want a way of keeping you inside

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colours, and I'm dying of thirst
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

So much that it hurts

So much that it hurts

----------------- Song name: True Love -----------------

For a second I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below would rise

And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time

Tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me

Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine

So tell me you love me
And if you don't then lie
Lie to me

Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
If you don't then lie
Oh, lie to me

And call it true, call it true love
Call it true, call it true love

----------------- Song name: Midnight -----------------

In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

Millions of miles from home
In the swirling, swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

----------------- Song name: Another's Arms -----------------

Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Used to be your arms around me
Your body on my body

When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms
Another's arms
When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Is there someone there to reach me?
Or someone there to find me?

When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms
That's just torture to me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Pull yourself into me
Another's arms
Another's arms
When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Got to pull you close into me
Another's arms
Another's arms
Pull yourself right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Late night watching TV
Wish that you were here beside me
Wish that your arms were around me
Your body on my body

----------------- Song name: Oceans -----------------

Wait for your call, love
The call never came
Ready to fall up
Ready to claim
I'm ready for it all, love
Ready for the pain
Meet under sun and
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain

Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
And I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for a change
Meet me in blue sky
And meet me again
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain

You've got to find yourself alone in this world
You've got to find yourself alone

----------------- Song name: A Sky Full Of Stars -----------------

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
Because you light up the path

And I don't care, go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do, ooh 
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart

And I don't care, go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you

'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view

----------------- Song name: O -----------------

Flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love

And I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
Fly on

Flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise
Following them up

Still, I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next, you know they're gone
Fly on

Fly on, oh
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day, I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day, I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on

----------------- Song name: All Your Friends -----------------

On and on
You're told which side you're on
I forced your throne
To become science to cut the con

All your friends think
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away we go
All your friends think
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away we're thrown
Into the fire

Ten below
Call comes in on the radio
I felt you go
And red now, all the rivers flow
Poppies grow

All your friends think
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away we blow
All your friends think
Ride into the sunset
Ride into the sunset
And we're taken home
Open fire
Open fire

Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
Just ride the fire

----------------- Song name: Ghost Story -----------------

Maybe I'm just a ghost
Disappear when anybody's close
Go through you when you travel
Travel over here

Maybe I'm just a ghost
Empty body, everybody knows
Maybe I'm on the ropes
Or I'm not even here

Every time I try to walk through walls
More walls appear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point of trying to raise your voice
If no one ever hears?
Every time you try to pull me close
You disappear

Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a whisper in a puff of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear

Or maybe I'm a ghost
Specter on a wrong course
Thorn without a rose
Something people fear

And every time I try to walk through walls
It's all becoming clear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point of saying "rescue me"
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

And every time I try to walk through walls
It's all becoming clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

----------------- Song name: A Head Full Of Dreams -----------------

Oh I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

Oh I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open-handed
When you got me lost for words
I sing oh-oh-oh

A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams
Into life I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

----------------- Song name: Birds -----------------

Been standing in the corner
Studying the lights
The dreaming of escape will keep you up at night
But someone had put the flares up
And got me in the rays
So I guess I'd better stay
"Uh uh, no, come on" you say

It's a fool's gold thunder
It's just a warring rain
Don't let the fears just start "what if
I won't see you again"
Around here you never want to sleep all night
So start falling in love, start the riot and

Come on rage with me
We don't need words
And we'll be birds
Got to make our own key

Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing
But geography

Come on and raise it
Come on and raise this noise
For the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on it's not over if you
Mean it say loud
Come on all for Love
Out from the underground
Away with me
We don't need words
Close your eyes and see
And we'll be birds
Flying free
Holding on in the mystery

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Fearless together
You said "we'll go through this together"
When you fly won't you
Won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you're so cool

----------------- Song name: Hymn For The Weekend -----------------

Oh angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up...

Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

You said 'drink from me, drink from me'
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low low low low

I oh I oh II oh...
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high so high
Oh I oh I oh I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high...

Oh angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low low low low...

I oh I oh I...
You got me feeling drunk and high
So high so high
Oh I oh I oh I...
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high

I oh I oh I...
La la la la la la la
So high so high

Oh I oh I oh I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the
That I shoot across the sky
Watch me shoot across the...

----------------- Song name: Everglow -----------------

Oh they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial

Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on, how come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should but I can't let you go?

But when I'm cold, cold
Oh when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night we'd be friends till we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling this everglow

Oh- I I I I
What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah I live for this feeling this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh the light that you left me will everglow

----------------- Song name: Adventure Of A Lifetime -----------------

Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends every day
That's what she told me

Turn your magic on
To me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
(Alive again)
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
(Alive again)
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape

Woo hoo
Woo hoo

If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh, then I
And if we've only got this life
You get me through, ah
And if we've only got this life
In this adventure, oh, then I
Want to share it with you
With you
With you
I see you, I see you

----------------- Song name: Fun -----------------

I know it's over
Before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it's over
An ocean awaits for a storm
The sun on snow
Rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over
A parting of ways
And it's done
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun
Oh ah ooh ooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
Could have been lost
Would have been saved
Oh ah, ooh ooh ooh
Now we're stopping the world
Stopping its spin
But come on don't give up don't say we give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Ah didn't we have fun?

I know it's over
Before she says
"Know someone else has taken your place"
"I know it's over"
Icarus says to the sun
The Sword sinks in
Lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight till it's over
Fight till it's done
Oh oh oh oh oh
Didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh ah ooh ooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost,
We would have been saved
Oh ah ah ah ah
Now we're stopping the world
Stopping in its tracks but
Nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over
Before you run
Ah ah
Didn't we have fun?

Cause you and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be
We were always meant to always meant to

You and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be

Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh oh didn't we have fun?

But then
Maybe we could again

----------------- Song name: Kaleidoscope -----------------

This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival

A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor

Welcome and entertain them all!
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide

----------------- Song name: Army Of One -----------------

Been around the world
The wonders to view
Been around the world
Looking for someone like you
Pyramids try
Babylon too
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I never say die
Aim never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

Been around the world
The universe too
I've been around flying, baby
It's nothing I wouldn't do
Tanzaku stars
Lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you right
When the storm comes through

'Cause I never say die
Aim never untrue
Never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire
That I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah

Cause you reign
All cause you reign
All cause you reign
My army of one is gonna call it through
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
It's my only weapon, army of one
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one

(So I reach for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Coming home and I'm finding no peace

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm out of luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know what you've got

I put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
Put my hands up to the sky, it's all right
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been innocent but a sinner in me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm not

I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
Put my hands up to the sky, it's all right
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) And I know, and I know, and I know
(So I reach for it) I know what I've got
X marks the spot

----------------- Song name: Amazing Day -----------------

We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof put your hand in mine
Life has a beautiful crazy design

And time seemed to say
Forget the world and its weight
And here I just want to stay
Amazing day amazing day

We sat on a roof, named every star
You showed me a place where you can be what you are

And the view, the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms I just want to sway
Amazing day amazing day
Amazing day amazing day

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh

And I asked
Can the birds in poetry chime?
Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?
Oh thanks God, must have heard when I prayed
Cause now I always want to feel this way
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Yeah, today

----------------- Song name: Colour Spectrum -----------------

Because each has been sent as a guide

----------------- Song name: Up&Up -----------------

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, Up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, Up and up

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, Up and up

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float
We're gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people
Break your heart? Break your heart?

Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to
Heal it up, heal it up

See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, Just need love
When the going is rough, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float
We're gonna get it, get it together and go

And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it's mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float
We're gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float
We're gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain, when you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up

Believe in love

----------------- Song name: Miracles -----------------

From up above I heard 
The angels sing to me these words
And sometimes in your eyes 
I see the beauty in the world

Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
Eyes

Sometimes the stars decide
To reflect in puddles in the dirt
When I look in your eyes
I forget all about what hurts

Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
And cry

Believe in miracles

Oh hey, I'm floating above the world now
Oh hey, I'm floating above the world now

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

----------------- Song name: All I Can Think About Is You -----------------

One, two, three

Fish fell out of water
Bird stuck on the ground
Chaos giving orders
Everything is upside down
The whole world on a flight path
I wonder where they'll go, ah
Trouble's on the outside, I know

But now, all I can think about is you
All I can think about is you
If all that I'm on earth to do
Is solo, then what a lone poor shoe
I want to walk in a two

Go
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

Everything is falling all around you
It's all I can do
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
Love is the only thing left that's true

----------------- Song name: A L I E N S -----------------

We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History has some to know
We were moving at the speed of flight

Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

Just an alien

We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line

Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
For a lifetime

Just an alien
Moving target
Target movement
A patch, a corner
Of the spacetime
Just an alien
Turning toward it
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

----------------- Song name: Hypnotised -----------------

Been rusting in the rubble
Running to a faint
Need a brand new coat of paint
I found myself in trouble
Thinking about what ain't
Never gonna be a saint

Saying float like an eagle
Fall like the rain
Pouring to put out the pain
Oh again and again

Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized

It's easy to be lethal
I'm learning from the news
It's a guidebook for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People want to choose
They just see it from different views

And threading the needle
Fixing my flame
Oh now I'm moved to exclaim
Oh again and again

How I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I lift and I'm mesmerized

Oh again and again
Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I lift to a permanent high
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
It was dark
Now it's sunrise

----------------- Song name: Help Is Round The Corner -----------------

Stuck here in the middle of nowhere
With a headache and a heavy heart
Oh well nothing was going quite right here
And I'm tired, I can't play my part

Come on, come on
Oh what a state I'm in
Come on, come on,
Why won't it just sink in
Help is just around the corner for us

Oh my head just won't stop achin'
I'm sat here lickin' my wounds
I'm shattered but it really doesn't matter
'Cause my rescue is gonna be here soon

Come on, come on
Oh what a state I'm in
Come on, come on,
Why won't it just sink in
Help is just around the corner for us
Help is just around the corner for us
Oh help is just around the corner for us

----------------- Song name: You Only Live Twice -----------------

Oh You only live twice or so they say
One life for yourself one for the rest

And you, You drift through the years and life seems strange
And one dream appears and love is its name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

Oh you, you only live twice or so it seems
One life for yourself, one for your dreams

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone, gone, gone

----------------- Song name: I Bloom Blaum -----------------

Darling, those tired eyes
Go with me all the time.
And in the dead of night
Tell me you will be mine.
Where do you go to, pretty baby?
Where do you go to, when the night wins away.
Ask me so sweetly, what do I do?
Who do I sing for?
Well honey I sing about you.
You.

----------------- Song name: 1.36 -----------------

Stuck in a corner
Are monkeys in cages
That don't have a number
To fight one another
Try to recover

Climb up the ladder
Look up and you see birds
Blind as each other
How long can we suffer?
We're as blind as each other

On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer

Sisters and brothers
Who fight one another
Will mourn and deceive us
Will find us and keep us
Take us or leave us

How soon is now? yeah
How long is never?
I'm nothing but normal
With something together
Come on stick together

On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer

----------------- Song name: I Ran Away -----------------

I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And though I started here
I ran away from you

I'm gonna come on in
And see it through

I ran away from you
That's all I ever do

And when I heard you call to
Come back to me
And though I should stay
I don't have the stomach to

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
There might be nothing left to do
So I ran away from you

I'm gonna come on in
My eyes are closed

I can feel it there
The sun's so close
I'm gonna come on out
And burn the sky

A star arose in my own cage
I'm stuck in line
And in a cage

Just a single star
I sing for

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
And I did not know what to do
And so I ran away from you

As far as poetry
Sit down and sing to me

'Cause all I want in this world
All I want in this world
Is for you to come home

A rebel yell
A spell

Soldier, come home to me
You've been away from me
So long

All I want in this world
All I want and deserve
Is for you to come home

A spell
A rebel yell

----------------- Song name: The Goldrush -----------------

I went digging for gold
I went down through the valley
Over by the mountain
Where the prospector had been told
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

I went digging for gold
I went down with my brother
A bucket and a shovel
And a book about the colour of coal
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying "What use the metal if the metal don't shine?"
She said "Bring me back a ring 'cause I really want one"
I've been digging so long that I never see the sun

I went digging for gold
I went down to the valley
Over by the mountain
Where the prospector had been told
We're marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying "What use the metal if the metal don't shine?"
She said "Bring me back a ring 'cause I really want one"
I've been digging so long that I never see the sun
I've been digging so long that I never see the sun
We've been digging so long that we never see the sun

----------------- Song name: How You See The World No. 2 -----------------

They put the world in a tin can
Black market, contraband
And it hurt just a little bit
When they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat
Two hands around the throat
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes

There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control?
Ah, if your hear can you let me know
How can they invade it
When it's so complicated?
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you learned

That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna give up

Ooh...

And there's something missing
Seems like there's nobody listening
If you're running in a circle
How can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man trapped
We don't wanna be shrink-wrapped

Oh...

We just wanna get it right sometimes
We just wanna get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
But you can't believe a word

That's how you see the world
Ah, don't you worry yourself
Cause nobody can hurt you...

Ooh
Ooh

Ooh

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world

----------------- Song name: A Message 2010 -----------------

My song is love
My song is love, unknown
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone

My heavy heart
Looks like it's made of stone
But it's so hard to see, clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
Oh I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm not singing on my own

That bitter breathe
That bitter breathe has blown
Left me on fire, for you, clearly
Taken everything and gone
It's taken everything I own

But I'm not gonna take it back
I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say
Oh I'm nothing on my own
Till that bitter breathe has blown

My song is love, Is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home

----------------- Song name: Christmas Lights -----------------

Christmas night, another fight
Tears we cried, a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood

I took my feet
To Oxford Street
Trying to right a wrong
Just walk away
Those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope

Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you, darling
And I always will

Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

Oh, Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights keep shining on

----------------- Song name: Atlas -----------------

Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow
Sometimes the wire
Must tense for the note
Caught in the fire
Say oh, we're about to explode

Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world

Some far away
Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay
Heaven, we hope, is just up the road
Show me the way Lord
Because I'm, I'm about to explode

Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world and all your hurt
Carry your world
Carry your world

----------------- Song name: Miracles -----------------

I forget all about what hurts

Oh, now I'm floating so high

Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
And cry

Believe in miracles

Oh hey, I'm floating above the world now
Oh hey, I'm floating above the world now

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm all by myself
I don't need anybody else
I'm all by myself
No help

I'm all on my own
Quietly sleeping in my home
I'm all on my own
My own

Hello
Won't you let me come in?
Lhuna
Can't you hear how much I'm suffering?
Hello
Won't you let me know?
'Cause I'm all alone
All alone

We are dreaming
About Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
Dreaming
About Lhuna
Her and me
Simultaneously 

I don't know what the time is
I don't know where you've flown
And I don't know why you're so far
From home

Hello
Won't you let me come in?
Lhuna
Can't you hear how much I'm suffering?
Hello
Won't you let me know?
'Cause I'm all alone
All alone

We are dreaming

The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
Dreaming
About Lhuna
Her and me
Simultaneously 
Her and me
Effortlessly 
Oh, her and me
Effortlessly

----------------- Song name: 2000 Miles -----------------

She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came down
Gets colder day by day, I miss her

I hear children singin'
It felt like Christmas time

In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle

And our hearts were singin'
It felt like Christmas time

2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go

She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came falling now
Gets colder day by day, I miss you

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

----------------- Song name: A Ghost -----------------

They're calling you
Some kind of ghost
But I know that's not true

Cause time and time again I spoke
And I have spoke with you

They're saying I 
Am some kind of ghost
But that's so hard to say

Maybe I'll go
Maybe you're safe

No there's no way to say...

And I would love you
To come over
And I would love you
Too

----------------- Song name: Bucket For A Crown -----------------

When you're sitting on a beach in a car with the paint dried up
Well, you're gonna give a 'cause when the rain washed up
Well being just there with the gypsy talking to my friend
But you'll never get with it if you don't get respect
Oh well you'll never get with it if you just want respect

But sometimes the money's gonna run out
And you'll be standing on the corner with a belly full of doubt
Sometimes somebodys gonna bring you down
And you'll be standing on your own with a bucket for a crown

Well me and the boys were standing thinking we were hip
I don't wanna be the captain of a sinking ship
Well me and the boys in a town where the Mormon go
Listening to a session by Noel Gallagher
I was listening to a session by Noel Gallagher

They said sometimes your money's gonna run out
And you'll be standing on a corner with a belly full of doubt
Oh someday somebody's gonna bring you down
And you'll be standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown
Oh you'll be standing on a corner
Just waiting on a corner
Standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown

----------------- Song name: Harmless -----------------

If you call and call
Your self esteem is low
And I heard you'd called
Is there no calling?
And away I go
Any way you go
I was on your tail
As clear as crystal

But it was harmless
It couldn't hurt you
Oh you were helpless
I know you'll get through
I know, I

Chemicals are cold
See you sit down on
A chemical you cause
Is like a crystal
So I heard you say
I got to get away
I'm on a second trail
As clear as crystal

But I was harmless
It couldn't hurt you
Oh you were helpless
I know you'll get through

----------------- Song name: Hunting High And Low -----------------

Here, I am
And beyond the reach of my hands
She's sound asleep
And she's sweet another know why
These dreams could've seen her
And I watched her slipping away
And I know I'll be hunting high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths
I'll go too high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths
I'll go too find her again
Upon this my dreams I depend
And, through the dark
I can hear the pounding of her heart
Next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find
So I know I'll be hunting high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths 
I'll go too high and low
High...
Do you know how it feels to love you?
Do you know how it feels to love you?
High and Low

----------------- Song name: Idiot -----------------

So I was an idiot
I was a god-damn idiot
Because I came here so violent
Because I came around here so violent

I said yes I was an idiot
I was a god-damn idiot
Because I made you think for it
Because I came round here to think for it

And sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive

My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot

Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot

I was an idiot
I fell down like a god damn idiot
Because I came here to bring them down
Because I came round here to fight them down
I said yes I felt like an idiot
I was a god damn idiot

Sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive

My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot

Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot

Listen now, it's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life

Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive

----------------- Song name: I'm A Believer -----------------

I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me.
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed.
Disappointment haunted all my dreams.

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
I'm in love, I'm a believer!
I couldn't leave her if I tried.

I thought love was more or less a given thing,
Seems the more I gave the less I got.
What's the use in tryin'?
All you get is pain.
When I needed sunshine I got rain.

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
I'm in love, I'm a believer!
I couldn't leave her if I tried.

----------------- Song name: Ladder To The Sun -----------------

From the very start
It came apart
It broke up into pieces and
There's a chance I could've missed it
It could risked it
But I put myself into your hands

'Cause you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun
Oh you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun

I could run my courses and
Opposing forces
And all men are just mortals, and
Oh if you want me then you can have me
Come on, take me, oh baby grab it

'Cause if you want me then you can have me
'Cause you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun
You're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun

Oh now boy what you been and done
You set a course that you couldn't run
Oh now boy what you been and done

I had it all and I risked it
I had it all and I risked it all
And I risked it all
And I risked it all

A ladder to the
A Ladder to the sun
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun

A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
And I risked it all
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun

----------------- Song name: Lost Highway -----------------

I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I past by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway 

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
On the day we met, oh I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I paid a cost, on the lost highway

Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway

Come on Marianne
The sun sets in your eyes
I'm in love again
Come on once or twice

Wanna be your air?
Come on now, all I see
Wanna ride along

Gonna lay the blame on me, not anyone
Gonna write a song
Sing it to the sun
Don't tell anyone

You're the only one I've ever loved
And I swear it on
Swear it on the moon and stars above

And, I wanna be your man

Gonna write a song and see how a woman feel
Come on get it on right into the sun
Gonna ride along and fly, gonna let it on

And I swear it on
Swear it on the moon and stars above
In my head you're the only one I've ever loved

----------------- Song name: Solid Ground -----------------

Oh, when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you.

Oh, I once was lost and now I'm found
I'm gonna do what I should do,
And when I get back on my feet again
I'm gonna run my way to you.

Oh, when all is lost and come undone
I'm gonna sing out, and see ya through.
But no, the water,
The water flows over.

Oh, when I get back off my feet again,
I'm gonna crown my days a turn.

So all I've been on my knees again,
And I'll do it all the time.

And when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you.

Oh, I once was lost, but now I'm found,
So here's what I'm gonna do.

I sing, oh, the water,
The water flows over.
I sing, oh, the water,
The water flows over you.

----------------- Song name: Songbird -----------------

Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a place not far away
She's a little pilot in my mind
Singing songs of love to pass the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
I never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone

A man can never dream these kind of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone

----------------- Song name: Spanish Rain -----------------

Ooh, eeh!
Ooh, eeh, ooh!
Ooh, eh!

So we left La Mancha,
Headed out for higher plains
Me and Sancho Panza

Looking for adventure,
Rosinante at the reigns,
To the windmills answer,

You'll never be lonely
You'll never be loney ever again

You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely again.

I heard you never get wet in Spanish Rain

So they sent the doctor
For examining my brain

Said : "He's not too clever"

When the world, when the world just seems
A little bit too cruel
Gonna leave it better
Make one better . Hey!

So tell that princess
Tell that princess right down the train
Tell that princess : She'll never be lonely again

I heard you never get wet in Spanish Rain

Ooh, eh!
Ooh, eh, ooh-oh...
Ooh eh

I heard you never get wet in Spanish Rain...

----------------- Song name: Streets Of Baltimore -----------------

Well I sold the farm to take my woman
Where she used to be
We left our kin and all our friends
Back there in Tennessee
And I bought those one way tickets
She had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore

Well her heart was filled with gladness
When she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth was
Baltimore at night
Well a man feels proud to give his woman
What she's longing for
And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore

Then I got myself a factory job
I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage
In a neighbourhood serene
And every night when I'd come home
With every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore

Well I did my best to bring her back
To what she used to be
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights
More than she loved me
Now I'm a going back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

----------------- Song name: Talk (Unreleased) -----------------

Under the great north star
Try to work out where you are
In the silence of the sea
I don't know where I've been
In the future, in the past
Going nowhere much too fast
When I go there go with me
Oh when I go there go with me

'Cause I don't know where I'm going but I wanna talk
I feel like I'm going where I've been before
And I wanna talk

Take a picture of
Something that you're not sure of
Bring it back to show me
But I don't know what I see
In the future, find a home
Getting nowhere on your own
Got to find your missing piece

'Cause you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before
And nothing's really making any sense at all
You'll tell any one who'll listen that you feel ignored
Let's talk, let's talk
Do you wanna talk?

I'm up in the part of the throne
I'm trying to sing a song
In a language I don't speak
I try but I can't get through
I'm trying to get to you
But you're difficult to reach

Won't you talk... to... me...

So you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before

Let's talk, let's talk...
Let's talk, let's talk...

----------------- Song name: The Nappies -----------------

Sometimes you're happy, sometimes you frown
With your hormones bouncin' up and down.
Sometimes you're happy, sometimes you're sad -
It's a weird nine months that you have had.

There's shit goin' down that you can't disguise
When your boobs've gone up ten times the size.
Your cup's gone up from an A to D,
That's bad for you but fun for me.

Now just 'cause a little bit of rumpy pump
Now you're walkin' 'round with a great big bump.
You might have thought as we're French you woulda said: "Non!"
(Or at least you woulda made me stick a condom on.)

I think you might find that it's really fun.
An oven's no use unless you make a bun.
It's something to learn, it really is -
Now you know what that sticky stuff is.

I'll be there with you, baby, through the thin and thick -
I'm gonna clean up all the poo and sick.
I'll be there to make you happy and keep everything clean.
I'll change the nappy for the washing machine!

I ain't no baddie, I ain't no baddie,
I ain't no baddie, I am your baby's daddy.

Sometimes you think: What a fool I am!
But why did I marry this awful man?
Now a baby's part of mah family plan.
But can it kick me? Yes, it can.

My name's Ken, and I've got three.
Do I like being a daddy? Yeah, definitely.
But I have to warn you, it's not all fun -
There'll be times that you wished you'd been a nun.

I'll be there for you, baby,
Through the thin and thick -
I'm gonna clean up all the poo and sick.

I'll be there to make you happy,
And I'll bring in the bread,
I'll be the nanny, you can go out instead.

I know that you'll be grumpy, that's what everyone says,
And you're not gonna to hump me for 42 days.
If you don't want more babies and you cannot disguise it,
I'll take my **** and vasectomize it.

I ain't no baddie, I ain't no baddie,
I ain't no baddie, sometimes I make you sad-die.

I ain't no baddie, I ain't no baddie,
I ain't no baddie, I am your baby's daddy.

Mother! Mother!

----------------- Song name: Wedding Bells -----------------

Those wedding bells ringing up upon that hill
And I don't wanna swallow such a bitter pill
You keep on moving but I stay still
But I always loved you and I always will
Days of no sleeping caked in mud
All kinds of poison in my blood
I lost the only thing I ever loved
I heard them ringing in precession by
Umbrellas in that clear blue sky
Saw you swimming in that sea of white
Those wedding bells ringing up upon that hill
And I don't wanna swallow such a bitter pill
You keep on moving and baby still
But I always loved you and I always will
I loved you and I see it still
But I always loved you and I always will
I loved you and I see it still
But I always loved you and I always will
If everything that went before didn't matter
I always loved you and I always will

----------------- Song name: What A Wonderful World -----------------

I see trees that are green, red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more, than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, oh what a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, saying, "How do you do?"
But they're really saying, "I love you"

I see trees that are green and red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, oh what a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
But they're really saying, "I love you"

I see trees of green and red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, oh what a wonderful world

I think to myself, ooh what a wonderful world

----------------- Song name: What The World Needs Now Is Love -----------------

What the world needs now
Is love, sweet love
No, not just for some
But for everyone

Yeah the world needs now
Some love, sweet love
That's the only thing
That there's just too little
(But not in Vancouver).. of!

----------------- Song name: Why Does It Always Rain On Me -----------------

I can't sleep tonight
Everybody's saying that it's all right
Still I can't close my eyes
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights

Sunny days
Where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling
You belong

Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning

I can't stand myself
I'm being held up by an invisible man
Still life on a shelf when
I got my mind on something else

Sunny days
Oh, where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling
You belong

Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning

Oh, where did the blue skies go?
And why is it raining so cold?
It's so cold

I can't sleep tonight
Everybody saying that it's all right
Still I can't close my eyes
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights

Sunny days
Oh, where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling
You belong

Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning

Oh, where did the blue skies go?
Why is it raining so cold?
So cold

Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning

Why does it always rain on me?
Why does it always rain on?
Oh
